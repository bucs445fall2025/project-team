## Getting Started
- This is a stock prediction app/website. We are not liable for any financial decisions that you make based on our data. You will find the true stock prices and our predictions for the future for each of the S&P500 stocks as well as a daily summary on how the stock is performing. We do not guarantee the accuracy of any of these predictions. If you are going to invest in the stock market, you can use this app as a tool to gather more information, but nobody can truly predict the future.
