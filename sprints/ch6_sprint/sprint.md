## Sprint 3 Review

### SRS Sections Updated

Personalize the experience - Personalization
I should be able to see different things or set up my view in a certain way that I like it. Since what I like could be different from what someone else like.
Secure user data - Security
This personalization should not be publicly available. My preferences/models should not be given to other people who didn’t create it. My password too obviously.
Cleanliness
It should be easy to update what we need later on. It should not take a rocket scientists to be able to update something when we need to change it later on
Update website automatically
New data should be automatically updated, as well as text on the screen can be updated automatically using ChatGPT
Upkeep
The website should be up >99% of the time, it shouldn’t crash because one user did some unintended action.
