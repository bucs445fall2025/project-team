**Clientâ€™s Response:**
- There is too much data in the financial world so I want to simplify that data into a simple "yes" or "no."

**Clarification & Notes:**
- I want to look at it and know if it's a good or bad investment opportunity rather than having to do research myself.

---

#### **4. What is the most important feature?**
**Clientâ€™s Response:**
- Must be accurate and intuitive.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- It has to be correct 100% of the time.
- I just want to look at the app and know whether or not to invest in something.

#### **5. Is there a similar product on the market?**
**Clientâ€™s Response:**
- Yes but Bloomberg is too expensive ($25k per computer).
  
**Clarification & Notes:**
- I want a simplified version of Bloomberg's terminal and it must be free.
- Also I need you to use AI to determine what data is important.

---

#### **6. Are there any existing products or technologies that will need to be integrated?**
**Clientâ€™s Response:**

**Clarification & Notes:**

#### **8. What risks are associated with a malicious user?**
**Clientâ€™s Response:**
- If everyone does it, our strategy won't work anymore.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- Need to charge enough for the service so that only a few people can access it, so it continues to work properly.
- Give non-premium users delayed data.

---

#### **9. What is the expected lifetime of this software?**
**Clientâ€™s Response:**
- Until the stock market collapses.

**Clarification & Notes:**
- No maintenance required because the AI should update itself.
- Or maybe just an AI engineer to help change the AI as the world evolves.
- Or maybe just make an AI that makes AI models so we can make a no human company.

#### **10. What additional features would you like?**
**Clientâ€™s Response:**
- Have a place where every stock in the world is displayed at once and show best performance/worst performance.

**Clarification & Notes:**
