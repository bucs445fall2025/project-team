# Stock Prediction

## **User Story**
As a Retail Investor
I want a fast way to tell me which stocks are undervalued/ will go up in the future
so that I can invest in it and make money

---

## **Acceptance Criteria**
- There is some sort of view that can tell me if a stock will go up in the future
- It has at least a 50% accuracy
- Show me a price range of where the stock is going to go

---

## **Notes**
- I think its really hard to predict a stock value, so I think we should predict a range instead
